# Leak report

One memory leak is caused by the program not freeing the "stripped" string once done with it. When running the `strip` function, a string with possible whitespace on the beginning and end is given as the parameter. `strip` then removes this whitespace and returns a string of everything in beween. However, `strip` is only called by the `is_cleaned` function which checks whether a given string has whitespace at the beginning or end and returns a "boolean" (either 1 if true or 2 if false). Since `is_cleaned` returns this "boolean" and not the actual result of cleaning the string, we do not need said result anymore and can free the string after making the comparison. Note: this is only necessary when the string being returned is not empty, otherwise there's no need to free it.
